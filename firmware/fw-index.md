# Firmware

Thesada nodes run one of two firmware approaches depending on the use case:

**ESPHome** is used for simpler sensor nodes where its built-in components cover the requirements. Configuration lives in `thesada-cfg/esphome/`. See the [Home Assistant](../home-assistant/esphome.md) guide and each module's ESPHome Config page.

**Custom firmware** (`thesada-fw`) is used where ESPHome lacks coverage - cellular fallback, Lua scripting, complex inter-module logic, or full control over the build. This section documents the custom firmware.

## Feature overview

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| WiFi multi-SSID | Ranked by RSSI; NTP synced on connect |
| LTE-M/NB-IoT fallback | SIM7080G modem-native MQTT over TLS; reverts to WiFi automatically |
| TLS MQTT | CA cert from LittleFS (`/ca.crt`); ISRG Root X1 works for Let's Encrypt brokers |
| HA MQTT discovery | Auto-registers all sensors in Home Assistant on connect; no manual YAML needed |
| DS18B20 temperature | OneWire, multi-sensor, auto-discovery, retry on disconnect, last-known-value fallback |
| ADS1115 current sensing | RMS sampling (30 samples over 2 cycles at 60Hz), outputs amps for SCT-013-030 |
| Battery monitoring | AXP2101 voltage, state of charge, charge status; MQTT publish + low-battery alert |
| SD card logging | CSV, per-boot files, configurable max file size with auto-rotation |
| Lua scripting | Lua 5.3 runtime; hot-reloadable rules, EventBus + MQTT bindings |
| Shell CLI | Commands over serial, WebSocket, HTTP (`POST /api/cmd`), and MQTT (`cli/#`) |
| OTA - push | Upload `.bin` via web dashboard or curl |
| OTA - pull | Fetch manifest from GitHub Releases, SHA256 verify, auto-install |
| PowerManager LED | Blue CHGLED: heartbeat pulse, hardware charge indicator, or off |
| NTP log timestamps | ISO 8601 UTC in log lines once clock is synced |
| Temperature alerts | Threshold rules with hysteresis, MQTT + HTTP webhook |
| Low-battery alerts | Fires when battery below `battery.low_pct`; hysteresis prevents repeat alerts |
