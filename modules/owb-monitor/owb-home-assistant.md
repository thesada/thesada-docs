# OWB Monitor - Home Assistant

![OWB in Home Assistant]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/home-assistant/owb-ha-dashboard.png)

The OWB monitor publishes sensor data via MQTT. From v1.0.17+, entities are auto-discovered by Home Assistant via MQTT discovery - no manual YAML needed. Entities appear automatically under **Settings - Devices & Services - MQTT** after the node connects.

Auto-discovery is enabled by default (`mqtt.ha_discovery: true`). A manual YAML config is maintained in [thesada-cfg/ha/mqtt/owb-sensors.yaml](https://github.com/Thesada/thesada-cfg/blob/main/ha/mqtt/owb-sensors.yaml) as a fallback.

---

## Prerequisites

- OWB node flashed and online (thesada-fw v1.1.0+)
- Mosquitto MQTT broker running (see [MQTT Integration](../../home-assistant/mosquitto.md))
- Telegram bot set up in Home Assistant (see [Telegram HA Integration](../../home-assistant/telegram.md))

---

## 1. MQTT Sensor Config

Copy [ha/mqtt/owb-sensors.yaml](https://github.com/Thesada/thesada-cfg/blob/main/ha/mqtt/owb-sensors.yaml) to your HA config directory and include it:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
mqtt: !include ha/mqtt/owb-sensors.yaml
```

Entities auto-discovered (v1.1.0+):

| Entity | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| House Supply | temperature | House loop supply (C) |
| House Return | temperature | House loop return (C) |
| Barn Supply | temperature | Barn loop supply (C) |
| Barn Return | temperature | Barn loop return (C) |
| House Pump | current | House pump RMS current (A) |
| Barn Pump | current | Barn pump RMS current (A) |
| House Pump Power | power | House pump power (W) |
| Barn Pump Power | power | Barn pump power (W) |
| Battery | battery | Battery level (%) |
| Battery Voltage | voltage | Battery voltage (V) |
| Battery Charge State | text | Charging / Discharging |
| WiFi RSSI | signal_strength | WiFi signal (dBm, diagnostic) |
| WiFi SSID | text | Connected network (diagnostic) |
| WiFi IP | text | Device IP address (diagnostic) |

Each sensor publishes on its own topic (e.g. `thesada/owb/sensor/temperature/house_supply`). Availability via LWT on `thesada/owb/status`. WiFi diagnostics are disabled by default in HA.

Verify the node is publishing:

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h YOUR_BROKER -p 8883 \
  -u mqtt-user -P YOUR_PASSWORD \
  --capath /etc/ssl/certs \
  -t 'thesada/owb/#' -v
```

## 2. Firmware Alerts vs HA Automations

The firmware sends alerts directly to Telegram via the Bot API when configured with `bot_token` and `chat_ids`. Alert logic lives in `/scripts/rules.lua` on the device (Lua-driven, hot-reloadable). See [Alerts & Webhook](../../firmware/architecture/alerts.md) for details.

HA automations are a second layer - useful for:
- Cross-sensor logic (e.g. supply/return delta)
- Time-based conditions (heating season only)
- Telegram `/temp` command responses

Both can run simultaneously.

---

## 3. Alert Automations (HA)

Three automations cover conditions the firmware alerts don't handle well (cross-sensor, time-based). Create each via **Settings - Automations - Create Automation - Edit in YAML**.

Replace `notify.YOUR_NOTIFY_ENTITY` with your Telegram notify entity.

### Supply Temperature Low

```yaml
alias: OWB Supply Temp Low
description: Alert when boiler supply drops below 40C
trigger:
  - platform: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.owb_house_supply
    below: 40
action:
  - action: notify.YOUR_NOTIFY_ENTITY
    data:
      message: >-
        OWB Alert: Supply temp low -
        {% raw %}{{ states('sensor.owb_house_supply') | round(1) }}{% endraw %}C. Check fire.
mode: single
```

### Loop Delta Collapsed

```yaml
alias: OWB Loop Delta Low
description: Alert when supply/return delta collapses below 5C
trigger:
  - platform: template
    value_template: >
      {% raw %}{{ (states('sensor.owb_house_supply') | float -
          states('sensor.owb_house_return') | float) < 5 }}{% endraw %}
    for: "00:05:00"
action:
  - action: notify.YOUR_NOTIFY_ENTITY
    data:
      message: >-
        OWB Alert: House loop delta low.
        Supply: {% raw %}{{ states('sensor.owb_house_supply') | round(1) }}{% endraw %}C
        Return: {% raw %}{{ states('sensor.owb_house_return') | round(1) }}{% endraw %}C
mode: single
```

### Pump Current Zero

```yaml
alias: OWB Pump Current Zero
description: Alert when pump stops during heating season
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.owb_house_pump_running
    to: "off"
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.owb_barn_pump_running
    to: "off"
condition:
  - condition: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.owb_house_supply
    above: 25
  - condition: template
    value_template: >
      {% raw %}{{ now().month >= 9 or now().month <= 5 }}{% endraw %}
action:
  - action: notify.YOUR_NOTIFY_ENTITY
    data:
      message: >-
        OWB Alert: {% raw %}{{ trigger.to_state.attributes.friendly_name }}{% endraw %} stopped.
        Supply: {% raw %}{{ states('sensor.owb_house_supply') | round(1) }}{% endraw %}C.
        Possible pump failure.
mode: single
```

## 4. Telegram Bot Commands

```yaml
alias: OWB Telegram /temp
description: Reply to /temp with current OWB readings
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: telegram_command
    event_data:
      command: /temp
action:
  - action: notify.YOUR_NOTIFY_ENTITY
    data:
      message: >-
        OWB Readings:

        House: {% raw %}{{ states('sensor.owb_house_supply') | round(1) }}{% endraw %} / {% raw %}{{ states('sensor.owb_house_return') | round(1) }}{% endraw %}C
        Barn:  {% raw %}{{ states('sensor.owb_barn_supply') | round(1) }}{% endraw %} / {% raw %}{{ states('sensor.owb_barn_return') | round(1) }}{% endraw %}C
        Battery: {% raw %}{{ states('sensor.owb_battery_percent') }}{% endraw %}% {% raw %}{{ states('sensor.owb_battery_charging') }}{% endraw %}
mode: single
```
