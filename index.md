# Thesada Documentation

Thesada is an open-source modular property monitoring platform built on ESP32 hardware with custom C++ firmware, MQTT over TLS, cellular fallback, and Home Assistant integration. Designed for rural and off-grid deployments where reliability matters.

Every build on [Foothills Builds](https://youtube.com/@FoothillsBuilds) gets fully documented here.

## What it does

- **Monitors** - temperature (DS18B20), current (ADS1115 + CT clamp), battery voltage and charge state
- **Alerts** - lua script defined alerts with hysteresis via MQTT, Telegram or webhook
- **Logs** - CSV data to SD card, logrotate included
- **Updates** - over-the-air via GitHub Releases (TLS-verified, SHA256 checked)
- **Scripted** - Lua runtime for custom rules without recompiling

## Where to start

- New to Thesada? Start with [Home Assistant](home-assistant/overview.md)
