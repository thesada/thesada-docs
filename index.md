# Thesada Documentation

Thesada is an open-source modular property monitoring platform built on ESP32 hardware with custom C++ firmware, MQTT over TLS, cellular fallback, and Home Assistant integration. Designed for rural and off-grid deployments where reliability matters.

Every build on [Foothills Builds](https://youtube.com/@FoothillsBuilds) gets fully documented here.

## What it does

- **Monitors** — temperature (DS18B20), current (ADS1115 + CT clamp), battery voltage and charge state
- **Alerts** — threshold alerts with hysteresis via MQTT and webhook, forwarded to Telegram through Home Assistant
- **Logs** — CSV data to SD card, logrotate included
- **Updates** — over-the-air via GitHub Releases (TLS-verified, SHA256 checked)
- **Scripted** — Lua 5.3 runtime for custom rules without recompiling
